    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah, but have you really thoughtabout it?</h2>
    <h3>Like, how if you out the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
    <h4>or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too</h4>

    <p class="special"> Making a pizza is similar to coding. There are certain things we have to do it first. 
        like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings,
        add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas end up the same, but they do start 
        out in the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to
        make many different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand. </p>
